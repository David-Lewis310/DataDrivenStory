      <p>The Federal government, under the Biden administration, has set guidelines to be carbon net 0 by 2050. Steps to ensure the country meets that deadline include eliminating all vehicles that produce cardon emissions. In order to meet the 2050 deadline America would need to switch its infrastructure to accommodate alternatively fueled vehicles. </p>
      <p>There are a few main types of alternative fueling available in the United States: Electric (EVs), E85 (Flex Fuel), BioDiesel, Compressed Natural Gas, Hydrogen, and Renewable Diesel. All of these options, except EVs, can easily be put into today’s vehicles with some modifications to accommodate the new compound.</p>
      <p>However, America would need 20 times more EV charging stations than it currently has, research from <a href = "https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/building-the-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-america-needs" target="_blank"> McKinsey & Co.</a>, a consulting firm, found in order to accommodate the 2050 deadline, and the amount of EVs the american people would have. So then why is the world making a push for EVs specifically?</p>
      <p>Well, that answer lies in what is readily available in large quantities. For the better part of the last three decades, EVs have been seen as the novel solution to our carbon emission woes. Because of this EVs experienced a vast technological advancement than the rest of the aforementioned fuel types. While these advancements have helped make EVs more affordable, <a href = "https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/advice/electric-car-prices" target="_blank"> U.S. News</a> found that the four cheapest EVs in 2024 cost an average of 30,000 dollars.</p>
      <p>Local utilities and the federal government offer plenty of incentives to offset the cost of installing an electric charging station at home and maintaining the vehicle in general. But as seen in the same <a href = "https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/advice/electric-car-prices" target="_blank">U.S. News article</a> three of the four cheapest EVs do not qualify for the United States’ EV tax credit.</p>
      <p>Even with all of these cost factors the main question remains of where does someone charge their vehicle. Different states at different levels when it comes to providing proper EV infrastructure for the public. Below is a map with the total number of public alternative stations in each state, it includes all of the fuel types listed at the top along with others that have very small populations.</p>

      <p>California leads all states in the number of alternative stations with 19,661, according to the <a href= "https://afdc.energy.gov/stations#/find/nearest" target = "_blank">Department of Energy’s map of alternative fueling stations</a>. California has been the most aggressive state in prioritizing personal vehicles transferring to electric. The analysis found that New York State comes in second with 4,534 public stations just beating out Texas with 4,373 and Florida with 4,068. In total, there are over 85,000 alternative fueling stations in America. </p>
      <p>The data also showed that EV charging stations, like California in comparison to other states, have a massive lead over other fuel types with 71,160 in America. Flex Fuel comes in second with just 4,554. </p>
      <p>Given these numbers it might seem as though, the infrastructure is already prevalent in most of the country. However, a lot of these electric charging stations are populated very densely across the country primarily in larger cities leading to a large population all vying for the same resource. </p>
      <p>Public stations are not a necessity but an in-home charging station, if they have a home with a garage or driveway, can cost up to $2,500 to install according to housing renovation site <a href ="https://www.fixr.com/costs/home-electric-vehicle-charging-station" target = "_blank">Fixr</a>. On top of that installation cost it will then raise the owner's electric bill. </p>
      <p>In a city like Syracuse, buying an electric car is not in the minds of most people. Taking a look at New York state infrastructure can also aid this claim. Below is a map with every New York State zip code and the number of alternative charging stations in each of them.</p>

      <p>This map, from the same <a href= "https://afdc.energy.gov/stations#/find/nearest" target = "_blank">Department of Energy data </a>as before, allows us to see that currently there is a bald spot in most rural areas but looking closer you can see similar bald spots in and around Syracuse. The most dense population of alternative fueling stations happens to be in Albany, not New York City as you might have thought. </p>
      <p>To examine this void in needed infrastructure I spoke to the Director of Sustainability at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Sue Fassler.</p>
      <p>“I really think the answer in urban and suburban areas is for the personal car, perhaps but we need to really focus our society more on active mobility, public transit, and getting people out of individual cars, more walkable cities,” Fassler said. “Like everything is related in tight and an ideal world, you can live in an urban core where you don't really need a vehicle.”</p>
      <p>The call from environmental experts like Fassler is to not just adapt the infrastructure around cars but to redesign our society to be as reliant on personal vehicles. Fassler also acknowledged while charging stations can be expensive certain adaptors are being created to allow EVs to “trickle charge.”</p>
      <p>“I don't think Syracuse would be any less good for an EV future than any other similarly sized city,” Fassler said. “I think if we have the DC (Direct Current) level through fast charging stations, at places where people like to recreate, there's a lot of recreation opportunities in Syracuse, and downtown urban cores would be good for something like that.” </p>
      <p>Electric vehicles are going to be a part of our future the current void in infrastructure would need to be filled before its too late and Syracuse falls behind current carbon emission guidelines.</p>

    <h3>About the data</h3>

    <div class="About the data">
      <p>Data was taken from the Department of Energy and accessed on April 4th, 2024. Data is updated daily by the Department of Energy. The link under each map will take you to the Department of Energy's interactive locater map. Some fueling stations are classified as Private, mostly on government property. Fueling stations may also be limited by restricted access for patrons of certain businesses.</p>
